# Tir: Search the Void

## [DEMO](https://robertpage.github.io/tir/)

My entry for jsk13 2021. Explore the vastness of space as a probe trying to spread the knowledge of a lost earth.

# About
Made to be self contained in a SVG. 8kb in size. The game randomly genrates a map at start. I believe traveling from one side of the map to the other takes about 7-ish hours. There are special things to find and generic celestial bodies. Arrow keys control movement and scanning/communicating with objects.

# Story
The earth has gone dark. A probe was sent to find intelligent life and tell them who we were so that we can live on in their memories.
